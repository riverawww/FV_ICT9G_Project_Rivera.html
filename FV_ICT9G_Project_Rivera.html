				<td><p>In reality, clutter in your home can cause fires to both start spontaneously and spread out of control. You can lower your risk and increase the likelihood that you can save your home from a fire by keeping your home less cluttered. Make sure to keep your home a little more tidy and get rid of some of the extra clutter since too much debris might allow the fire a lot of room to spread. </p><href>https://staysafe.org/how-to-prevent-fire-in-your-home/</href></td>

				<td><img src="Remove Lint And Change Filters.jpeg" class="rounded" width="240" height="150"> <p>Remove Lint And Change Filters</p></td>
				<td><p>To function, your heating system needs a filter, but how frequently do you replace it? Because the heat from the furnace can really set lint on fire if it builds up in the filter, you should be changing it frequently. The same holds true for your dryer. Every time you do laundry, you should be sure to clean the lint out of your dryer filter. A tiny bit of lint might start a massive fire.</p><href>https://staysafe.org/how-to-prevent-fire-in-your-home/</href></td>

			<tr>
				<td><img src="Keep Flammable Items Away From Heat.jpeg" class="rounded" width="240" height="150"><p>Keep Flammable Items Away From Heat</p></td>
				<td><p>Always keep flammable materials, such as fabrics, paper, and even hair, away from sources of high heat or flame. When lighting a fire in your fireplace, you should keep your clothing and hair out of the way. The stack of papers should not be placed near your wax melter. Also, you want to confirm that you're keeping a watchful eye out for anything that might develop into an issue. It's important to keep an eye on heat sources and anything nearby if you don't want a fire to start anyplace.</p><href>https://staysafe.org/how-to-prevent-fire-in-your-home/</href></td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><img src="putoutthefire.jpeg" class="rounded" width="240" height="150"><p>Put Out The Fire</p></td>
				<td><p>The use of a fireplace necessitates constant attention to what you're doing. In order to observe the fireplace and ensure that the fire doesn't rekindle, you should be sure to turn out the fire well before you plan to leave the area. Logs can continue to have flames inside them that appear years later, and embers can continue to smolder and burn. Before you go to bed or leave the house, you should make sure the fire is entirely put out and keep an eye out for any more fires that might emerge later.</p><href>https://staysafe.org/how-to-prevent-fire-in-your-home/</href></td>
